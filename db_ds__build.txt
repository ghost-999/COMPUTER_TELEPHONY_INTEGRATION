DePaul CTI Data Set
===================
 
This data set contains the preprocessed and filtered sessionized data 
for the main DePaul CTI Web server (http://www.cs.depaul.edu). The 
data is based on a random sample of users visiting this site for a 2 
week period during April of 2002. The original (unfiltered) data
contained a total of 20950 sessions from 5446 users. The filtered data
files were produced by filtering low support pageviews, and eliminating
sessions of size 1. The filtered data contains 13745 sessions and 683
pageviews.

DETAILED DESCRIPTIONS OF DATA FILES
===================================

cti.cod
-------
This file contains the list of the pageview in the filtered data set
along with a pageview id (between 0 and 682). The pageview ids
corresponds to the columns in the file "cti.std" which contains the
session data in a standard spreadsheet format (see below).

cti.tra
-------
This file contains the filtered sessionized data in transaction format.
Each line in this file corresponds to the sequence of pages visited 
during one session. Note that there is a direct correspondence between
the rows in this file and the rows in the file "cti.std". While the 
order of occurrence of pageview in each session represents the order in
which these pageviews were visited, the transactions do not contain
repeated visited to the same pageview in the same session. Thus, only
the first access to a pageview is recorded as part of the transaction.

cti.std
-------
This file contains the filtered sessionized data in a standard 
spreadsheet format. The file represents a session-pageview matrix where 
each column is a pageview (columns correspond to the pageview ids in the
file "cti.cod") and each row is a session represented as a vector.
The entries in the table correspond to the amount of time (in seconds)
spent on pageviews during a given session. The pageview durations were
maxed out at 999 seconds. For each session, the pageview duration of
the last pageview in that session, was estimated to be the average
duration of that pageview across all sessions (in which the pageview
does not occur as the exit page).

cti-stats.txt
-------------
This file contains statistical information about the original
(unfiltered) data set, including general statistics on the total
number of users and sessions, as well as statistics on all pageviews
occurring in the data. Pageview statistics include the support
(percentage of sessions in which the page view occurs), session
count, and average duration.

cti.nav
-------
This file contains the full (unfiltered) preprocessed sessionized
data. Each session in begins with a line of the form:

SESSION #n  (USER_ID = k)

where n in the session number, and k is the user id. There may be
multiple consecutive sessions corresponding to the same user id (repeat
users). Each sessions ends with a "dashed line". Within a given
session, each line corresponds to one pageview access. Each line in a 
session is a tab delimited sequence of 3 fields: time stamp, pageview 
accessed, and the referrer. The time stamp represents the number of 
seconds relative to January 1, 2002.
